# PayPal Integration Fix

This repository now includes a complete PayPal integration solution that addresses the "Al parecer el sitio no está funcionando en este momento" (site not working) error when PayPal tries to redirect users after payment.

## Problem Solved

The original issue was that PayPal couldn't access the return URLs due to:
- Dynamic URL generation causing DNS resolution issues
- Server accessibility problems from PayPal's IP ranges
- Lack of proper logging to diagnose the issues

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Hardcoded URLs (✅)
- Replaced dynamic URL generation with hardcoded absolute URLs
- Centralized URL configuration in `scripts/tienda/config.php`
- URLs are now reliable and accessible from PayPal

### 2. Simple Fallback Page (✅)
- Created `compra-simple.php` as a minimal fallback page
- Works as cancel URL and backup return page
- Always accessible and lightweight

### 3. Detailed Logging (✅)
- Comprehensive logging in all PayPal-related files
- Tracks PayPal access attempts, IP addresses, and parameters
- Separate log files for different components

### 4. Server Configuration Verification (✅)
- Built-in accessibility testing
- PayPal IP range verification
- Configuration validation

## Files Created/Modified

### Core PayPal Integration
- `scripts/tienda/paypal_tienda.php` - Main PayPal class with hardcoded URLs
- `scripts/tienda/config.php` - Centralized configuration
- `scripts/tienda/paypal_ipn.php` - IPN (payment notification) handler

### Return Pages
- `compra-exitosa.php` - Success page with detailed logging
- `compra-simple.php` - Simple fallback page

### Testing & Documentation
- `test-paypal.php` - Test page to verify integration
- `.gitignore` - Excludes logs and sensitive files

## Configuration

1. **Update the base URL** in `scripts/tienda/config.php`:
   ```php
   const BASE_URL = 'https://yourdomain.com'; // Replace with your domain
   ```

2. **Set your PayPal email** in `scripts/tienda/config.php`:
   ```php
   const PAYPAL_EMAIL = 'your-paypal-email@example.com';
   ```

3. **Switch to production** when ready:
   ```php
   const USE_SANDBOX = false; // Set to false for live payments
   ```

## Testing

1. Visit `/test-paypal.php` to verify the integration
2. Check that all URLs are accessible
3. Test a payment flow using PayPal sandbox
4. Monitor logs in the `logs/` directory

## URLs Used

The integration uses these hardcoded URLs:
- **Success:** `https://yourdomain.com/compra-exitosa.php`
- **Cancel:** `https://yourdomain.com/compra-simple.php`
- **IPN:** `https://yourdomain.com/scripts/tienda/paypal_ipn.php`

## Logging

Logs are created in the `logs/` directory:
- `paypal.log` - General PayPal operations
- `paypal_access.log` - Success page access attempts
- `paypal_fallback.log` - Fallback page access
- `paypal_ipn.log` - IPN processing
- `paypal_ipn_errors.log` - IPN errors

## Security Features

- PayPal IP verification
- IPN signature validation
- SSL certificate verification
- Transaction deduplication
- Comprehensive error logging

## Next Steps

1. Replace example configuration with your actual values
2. Test thoroughly in sandbox environment
3. Switch to production when ready
4. Monitor logs for any issues
5. Consider adding database integration for user credits

## Troubleshooting

If PayPal still can't access your return URLs:
1. Check server firewall settings
2. Verify SSL certificate is valid
3. Test URL accessibility from external services
4. Review server access logs
5. Check PayPal's IPN history in your PayPal account

The integration now provides robust logging to help diagnose any remaining issues.
